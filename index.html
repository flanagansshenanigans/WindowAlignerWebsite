    <h1>Window Aligner</h1>
    <p>
      This is the homepage of the window aligner. <br />
      This is a temporary home while I sort out the redirections / rules of my router. </br>
      Its also a free product and so the website is not at the top of my to do list.

        I have a ultra wide monitor, so the resolution is 5120x1440. When I play games I multi task and so will often put games in windows mode and most games have static resolutions.
        So if I put the resolution at half screen size 2560x1440, then the title bar takes up space and I loose UI stuff (e.g. Dyson Sphere's energy bar).
        This will align the window where you want, if you choose bottom left you will find the title bar will be above the screen but you get back those missed pixels.

      One issue is that some programs keep refreshing their position, but I've personally only found one.
